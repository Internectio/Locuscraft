# What is Locuscraft?

I'll try to explain it as concisely as I can. Locuscraft has two parts: the community, and the individual.

**The Community:** Locuscraft is a website where all internet users in the world can collaborate together to organize and review the information of the internet. The goal is to create a captivating, engaging, and streamlined user interface whereby anyone can contribute, and *everyone* will want to.

**The Individual:** Locuscraft is a centralized, organized, and personalized internet homepage for the individual and their internet experience. It will keep track of the user's interests, goals, and routines through a user profile. It will continuously display updated information based on the user's interests; assist the user in accomplishing his/her goals; and make their routines more efficient and focused. 

Locuscraft builds upon some of the great internet inventions we all know. Reddit's subreddits and posts, Wikipedia's wikis, the internet user profile, Amazon's categorization. By combining all of them together, we can create a unified, innovative, and truly entertaining internet experience that synergizes our common goals with our individual needs.

In addition, Locuscraft will allow users to review anything easily. This will allow *everyone* to: gauge public opinion, find the truly best products (and therefore improve the quality of products), and have quality sources of information. Locuscraft will also: have guides for learning or building anything, allow collaboration on anything, be incredibly ease to use, and have unlimited individual personalization. 

To top it all off, Locuscraft will be **Open source**, **ad-free**, and have an **honest and user centered privacy policy**. 

Locuscraft isn't just going to be another website. We aim to bring out the true potential of the internet - a website of the internet users, by the internet users, and for the internet users. 

# Why Locuscraft?

We live in a world of corporations where money runs everything, and whomever has the most money has the most power. Power over everything from what we buy to our opinions and values. It doesn't have to be the way. Sure we can't just tear down the skyscrapers and put the rich in jail, but there is something we can do. Just sidestep them. Bypass their stubborn old ways. We can create our own community on the internet, create our own values, have our own opinions -  opinions not given to us by the media. We will grow and grow as they recede into history. It's simple. The world may be run by corporations, but the internet - the future - can be run by everyone.

Locuscraft's motto is "Learn. Build. Share." because this is fundamentally how humans should live. Learn, then build something with that knowledge, then share our knowledge and creations to make the world better. These actions should be their own reward, but in a capitalist system, it's jacked up. We learn and build what's in a select fews' best interests, and we don't share our knowledge or creations unless people pay. This leads to road blocks where there shouldn't be any, crime, poverty, ignorance, waste, pollution, stress. Just open your mind and ask yourself, "are we really at the pinnacle of human achievement?" We're at the tip of the iceberg and the iceberg is melting fast.

Locuscraft isn't going to fix everything. What it will do is give us a voice. It will allow us to see what we all really think, what we really know - not as a nation, not as an organization, but as a people, as a globe, as one. The internet has no borders. Therefore it is the key to our unity.

# Who am I?

I'm a 24 year old with a degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering. I could get a well paying job somewhere if I wanted but I don't. I could cite sources for my reasons, but I'm not going to go into it. In the end I need creative freedom. I don't want to live my life like [this guy](http://www.lindsredding.com/2012/03/11/a-overdue-lesson-in-perspective/) did. Even if I don't have a fancy job, I still use my degree, working for myself. Though I really only use the programming side of it (I should have majored in information or computer science).

Some people live in the past, some in the present, some in the future. I'm definitely future oriented (though my brother makes sure I enjoy the present). I dream of my future home. Not fancy cars, not a $3000 couch, hell no. I imagine a vast garden that I grow vegetables, herbs, and fruit in. It's hydroponic in a greenhouse with an automated irrigation system, and I built it all myself. It's not just one house, it's a complex of houses, modestly sized, with my friends and family each living in one. Every one of them is solar powered. I designed them myself. It's situated 30 minutes outside of a medium sized city in a forest near a mountain and a river. I picked that location. I have kids and I'm teaching them math, science, reading, history, and any time it's possible to apply what I'm teaching them we do it, together. I have a daily routine of exercising, researching, building, teaching, and relaxing.

I'm a learner, a builder, and most importantly, a sharer.

Being future oriented, I plan. I spend many days and nights brainstorming, running through abstract thoughts, and coming up with ideas. I bounce my ideas off my girlfriend or my friend. The good ideas I write down. Then the next day I go over them again and see if they're as good as remember. Locuscraft is one that was. I got excited just thinking about it, and again when writing the outline. The more details I wrote, the more real it became. It's doable!  I've been planning it for almost a year now. 

I was going to try to create Locuscraft by myself and see if I could get rich, then pursue other projects. I thought about it a lot. The more I thought about it, the more I realized it's greater than me. I realized my own desires were limiting its potential. To reach it's greatest potential, it has to be created by all of us, shared by all of us, run by all of us... It could be a collective system of human knowledge, planning, and interconnections... Locuscraft could be *humanity's brain*. Our global IQ would shoot way the hell up. That's why I can't make it just another for-profit scam. It just wouldn't be what we need. We need pure, advertisement-and-ulterior-motive-free, original human thoughts. We *need* Locuscraft!

#Where the Project is at

Other than tons of planning, outlining, and making this readme, here's what I've done so far. I have reserved the domain space [locuscraft.com](http://www.locuscraft.com), .net, and .org. Locuscraft.net and .org just point to .com. I built the homepage with Bootstrap, check it out. It's really just a placeholder for now. You can make an account and login but can't do anything yet other than log back out. I am hosting the website with an Arvixe shared server, which also includes cPanel and unlimited mySQL databases. Once we get a decent user base and acquire dontations or funding, I would like to upgrade the server to a dedicated server so we can handle a higher load of traffic. 

As for the rest of Locuscraft (the user interface, profile, all functionality), it has not been built yet. It is beyond my current level of programming, so I have turned to creating it with Django 1.9, which is supposed to make creating web apps easier and quicker. I've been going through the tutorials but there is a lot to learn still. That's when I decided to just get some damn help.

So that is where I'm at. Sharing my idea, and getting help. If you have programming experience or have any other way you can help, give me a shout! I need people to design the interface (which you can read about in detail below), both the front-end and back-end. 

By the way, you may be wondering why it's called "Locuscraft". This is partially a result of me finding a suitable domain space, but it has a meaning too. Locus means a place, a center, a focus. To craft is to build. Therefore Locuscraft a single place to bring everyone together and build something together. I also wanted it to sound like a game, because Locuscraft is going to be entertaining as hell I promise you.

# Locuscraft Site Map

Please view the [site map](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11935672/9317205/bcc63562-44ff-11e5-85bd-9766431f23d1.png) to get a visualization of the website.

# Site Planning Questionnaire

*Who is the target audience?*

Everyone. Ideally Locuscraft would become a tool that improves everyones day-to-day utility of the internet.

*How can I tailor the web site to reach that audience?*

Make the website as instrumental, intuitive, and user friendly as possible so that anyone with any background or experience may use the website.

*What are the goals for the site?*

1. To create an organized and centralized hub of the internet's information and services. Locuscraft will help users find information and services on the internet through a search engine and categorization, much like how one might find a product on Amazon by navigating to the department (or category) the product is in. User's will also discover information through interests and tasks (more on that below).

2. To cater towards each user's interests and goals as much as possible, by providing them with an extensively customizable profile. This will allow users to better manage their time and utility while on the internet, as well as provide an entertaining, useful, go-to internet home. Whether the user's goal is to do research, to be entertained, to socialize, etc., Locuscraft should cater to and help the user accomplish this. Ways of accomplishing this will be discussed below.

3. To utilize user data for the good. Privacy is incredibly important, especially for a website that learns so much about it's users. This is why the software must be open source and viewable by anyone. Once privacy is accomplished and ensured, user data can be collected either anonymously or at user discretion, then publicized, used for research, or other purposes. For example, there will be many tasks related to the user's opinion of something. This information will be collected and shared so users can see the general consensus about a topic, company, product, etc. This could be a revolution in gauging public opinion.

4. To build a large and dedicated user base. None of the other goals are possible without the help of many, many users. In order to make the website more engaging and make users come back, we must give users great utility, and use some psychology. By psychology I mean giving them freedom in personalization and functions; rewarding them with points, ratings, comments, and views; and giving them something truly new and useful.

*How will the information be gathered?*

All of the information will come from the users. All we (the developers) have to do is create the interface that the users will use. Then the users will take care of information categorization and organization (tongue twister there). Information could come in the form of links, multimedia, and text. It could come from references to websites, profile information (based on privacy settings), polls they have answered, comments, uploads, and maybe other sources. Tasks, points, and posting will be the main driving force for gathering this information.

*What are my sources for multimedia content?*

Right now, I am creating all the multimedia content myself, or creating different images using free stock images from the internet and modifying them. I have done this with the logo and background images on the front page. I am somewhat particular about the style of the website. I feel that it should be awe-inspiring and give people a sense of discovery the moment they see the front page. The interface should be minimalistic and uncluttered to make it as easy as possible to navigate and understand.

*What is my budget?*

My own pocket for the time being. I am open to donations and would like to expand if I acquire enough. I would like to have enough income from this project to make it my full-time job and move out of the house I am living in, but if you would like to contribute for a specific purpose, such as some internet service or dedicated servers, I'm sure we can arrange it!

*How long do I have to complete the project?*

I will work on this as long as it takes, but I would like to get it going ASAP. Currently, working by myself, it could be a year before I have a basic usable user interface for the website. I am still learning how to use Django. The more people we get working on this, the sooner it will revolutionize the internet.

*Who is on my project team?*

No one yet. I would love to hear from anyone who has experience programming and wants to help. Also if you have constructive criticism or a suggestion for the project, I would like to hear it.

*How often should the site be updated?*

Probably daily but that is down the road.

*Who is responsible for updating the site?*

Just me for the time being.


# More about my Plan

##Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is critical to Locuscraft's user friendliness. It must be intuitive to use and provide quick access to everywhere else on the site. The navigation bar excludes logged in users' information. It is the navigation for all users logged in or out. 

The navigation bar at the very least will have the "home" link to the Locuscraft front page, and a search bar. The search bar could have a category drop down to search by category (like Amazon's search by department).

The rest of the navigation bar is dependent on the functionality of Locuscraft. There needs to be a way to browse Locuscraft's entries in a variety of ways i.e. by category, popularity, featured, etc. There's products, subjects, and sponsored.

##Entries

Locuscraft entries are similar in nature to a Wikipedia entry. What is meant by entry is simply a subject/article/category of information, such as an entry about apples. Wikipedia was a revolutionary creation for the internet. It made paper encyclopedias obsolete with its plethora of encyclopedia based knowledge that its users, not the Wikimedia Foundation, added to the website. What can Locuscraft use from Wikipedia's example? What can Locuscraft bring to the table? 

Take a look at the [entry for Apple on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple). It contains a vast amount of information about the simple fruit including its history, cultural aspects, cultivation, nutrition and then some. Similarly to Wikipedia's article for the apple, Locuscraft will have an entry likely with a table of contents with similar information. What does Wikipedia lack for the apple that the internet has, or could have? How about recipes? How about what people think about apples? How about a place to comment on the subject? Videos, pictures, and other multimedia? Where to buy apples on the internet? Locuscraft's purpose is to bring the internet of information about a subject into one central place. This is specifically the purpose of the entry. At the moment, Locuscraft entries will include the following:

* Basic, need-to-know, information about the subject, followed by an expandable section of additional, useful, common and uncommon information about the subject, followed by the best places (websites) on the internet to learn more about the subject.
* Latest news on the subject.
* If the subject is related to a discipline or art, there will be a guide for learning that art. In the case of apples, this could be recipes or cultivation.
* Videos, pictures, and other multimedia of the subject found on the internet.
* Locuscraft user statistics relating to the subject (such as users' favorite apples, percent of user's that like apples, etc.).
* User created tasks (more about tasks below) for the subject (such as give your opinion about apples, answer a questionaire or poll about apples, contribute to apple research, etc.)
* A list of communities/organizations/clubs relating to the subject.
* A list of other subjects closely related to the subject.
* Forums on the subject.
* The ability to add the subject to your interests.

All of this vast amount of information for each entry needs to be well organized, and the user should be able to further organize, or filter the information the way they want. Each division/bullet point should be orderable in different ways (similar to how posts on Reddit can be ordered), where appicable, such as: newest; "hot"; top posts by hour, day, week, month, year; rising, etc. There will also be a search bar which allows you to quickly search for information within the subject.

###Categorization

Locuscraft should very much be a place of discovery. The first word in our motto is "learn". If you don't discover new information, then your learning is limited to things you already know about. Google is amazing and makes good information on the internet findable. The problem is, you have to know, or at least have an idea of what it is you are searching for. 

The purpose of categorization is to make entries you might be interested in more easily discoverable, by throwing them into branches you already have an interest in. An excellent example of categorization is Amazon's "shop by department". It breaks every product on their website down into categories. A user like myself might just go to "Electronics & Computers" then click "Wearable technology" and discover products I never knew existed. After clicking this, you can break the department down into even narrower sub-categories. Why not do this with the internet's information too? If we value the internet so much, why shouldn't we pitch good information and sell it to internet users the same way Amazon markets its products to customers?

Categories will be hierarchical, meaning there will be top-level, mid-level (possibly multiple), and bottom-level categories. Categories are used to give users another way to browse, find, or discover entries. Let's say a user is looking to buy a new chainsaw as an example. It could be navigated to like this: 

Products > Patio, Lawn, & Garden > Lawn Mowers & Outdoor Power Tools > Chainsaws

This is actually how you would find a chainsaw on Amazon.com.

####Top-Level Categories

There are three top-level categories at this time: Subjects, Products, and Sponsored.

#####Subjects

These include basically anything you would find on Wikipedia, minus any articles about a specific product. It could be people, places, ideas, companies, etc. These entries will include information laid out in a similar way to the apple example above.

#####Products

These would be basically anything you would find on Amazon. They will be laid similarly to subjects but with more of a focus on the quality of the product, where to buy the product, reviews on the product, etc. They will include something similar to the following:

* Basic, need-to-know, information about the product, followed by an expandable section of additional, useful, common and uncommon information about the product, followed by the best places (websites) on the internet to learn more about the product.
* Latest news on the product if applicable.
* A list of subjects related to the product
* Videos, pictures, and other multimedia of the product found on the internet.
* Locuscraft user statistics relating to the product (users' preferences on the category of products, number of users with an interest in that product, etc.)
* User created tasks (more about tasks below) for the subject (such as write a review about the product, answer a poll of where you buy products in a category, etc.).
* A list outlets that sell the product, ordered by cheapest, most reliable, most consumers, etc.
* Reviews on the product, including reviews from other websites.
* Buying guides for the product. Using vacuums as an example, you should be able find the best vacuums in different price tiers, with different functions, reliability, durability, portability, etc.
* The ability to add the product to your interests.

  Locuscraft will hopefully become a source for unbiased product reviews and buying guides for any and all products. Product entries will be different than subject entries, as they will be focused on the quality of the product, sources of the product, reviews of the product, etc.
  
#####Sponsored

I've included this category as a potential source of revenue for Locuscraft. 

Some organizations, communities, or individuals would surely like to create their own entries that target their consumers, members, or anyone else; or maybe they want to make a personal entry just for fun. For whatever reason, these groups/individuals will be able to buy a sponsored entry. Names for sponsored entries must be approved in order to confirm the individual/group has the right/trademark to that name (maybe?).

Sponsored entries come with their own perks that other entries do not. Sponsored entries will be linked to a locuscraft account, and that account will have admin like privileges over that entry. These privileges include full control over the tasks; whether the entry is open to the public or requires private membership; what Locuscraft users can change or add to the entry, or forums; and anything else associated with entries.

There will be different price tiers, each tier changing the visibility of the entry to Locuscraft users (though views and ratings are the greatest factor for visibility). Since sponsored entries could become a source of misinformation or advertisement, they will only be visible in certain places. They will not be mixed in with posts and tasks unless a user subscribes to the sponsored entry. Sponsored entries can be found under navigation pages, certain categories, certain sorts/filters like highest rated (if it has a high rating), and possibly at the bottom of the users' homepage under its own heading by default (they'll be able to change what's displayed on their homepage). User's will only be able to subscribe to their posts and tasks if it doesn't require membership or if they are a member.

As an example, say McDonald's buys a sponsored entry and they make it publicly accessible. They could create tasks that give them information about their consumers, such as surveys. Users can then earn community points by completing McDonald's tasks.

I consider sponsored entries to be somewhat low on the list of priorities. Subject and product entries should certainly be finished first.

####Low-Level Categories

These will be applied with tags, like people might put keywords for a photo. With the apple example, it would be tagged with fruit, food, plant, tree, cooking etc. 

####Mid-Level Categories

These can also be applied to an entry with tags. With the apple example, food and plant are mid-level categories since they have lower-level categories like fruit and tree below them.

If an entry only has low-level category tags like fruit though, then Locuscraft will automatically be able to fill in the mid-level categories. Say apple was only tagged with the tag "fruit", then Locuscraft should automatically know that fruit falls under the mid-level category food. 

If browsing for apples one could go to Subjects > Plants > Trees > Apple. Alternatively one could go to Subjects > Food > Fruit > Apple. Maybe that's a bad example since one is referring to an apple tree and one is an apple the fruit. But just understand that a single entry can be navigated to through different branches of the category hierarchy, assuming it falls under multiple categories.

##User Profile/Homepage

Picture the user profile and homepage as you would Facebook's. On Facebook, the user can add interests to their profile. The user can subscribe to a page and see posts made from another user/organization. The user sees an "activity feed" of all their friends and subscriptions. All of this is similar to the Locuscraft, except instead of being centered around other users, socializing, and status, the Locuscraft profile will be centered around interests, goals, and contributing to the internet (tasks). New users’ homes will display suggestions for where they should start.

###Profile Page

This will display everything related to the user. This includes their points, their interests, their contributions, their tasks, their history, their statistics, and anything else I missed.

###Points

**Community Points**

Users can earn community points by completing tasks. Community points are a measurement of what a user has contributed to the community, to Locuscraft, and therefore to the internet itself. Points are a free source of positive reinforcement for the users and will encourage them to keep up the good work.

Similar to Reddit's karma, any user will be able to see any other user's points. Therefore points could become a representation of status. To further their value, a leaderboard could keep track of users with the most points. Eventually, I would like to make points unlock actual things for the user's profile as well, such as custom skins or avatars, maybe web tools. I'm open to other ideas.

Read about [Tasks](.####Tasks) below to see ways community points can be earned.


**Other Points**

I had planned on including another type of points, called locus points, which would be awarded for completing tasks that affect only that user. I came to the conclusion that this would just add complexity and confusion to tasks. For example how do you gauge if a user read an article, watched a video, or did something for themselves in the real world like mow the lawn? It would be much more trouble than it's worth and these tasks are done for personal reasons anyway.

###Interests

Adding an interest is basically the same thing as subscribing to a subject entry. The user can navigate to a subject and click add to interests at the top. By adding an interest, the user adds that entry's activities and tasks to their activity feed, and therefore their activity feed will reflect their own interests. 

Say one of the user's interests is funny stuff, they can add "comedy" to their interests. Comedy itself would be a mid-level category with many categories below it, so adding humor would add all of the bottom-level categories beneath it. This could be fine-tuned to that user's sense of humor.

New accounts will have a few default interests that everyone starts with, including comedy, similar to the way new Reddit users start with default subreddit subscriptions.

###Activity Feed

The activity feed is the medium through which the user will do things on Locuscraft/the internet in a personalized and exploratory way. Activies in the activity feed will be a reflection of their interests. The activies can be filtered and sorted in various ways including most popular, highest rated, newest, and other more specific ways depending on the activity and category.

There will be periodic suggestions in the activity feed to give the user ideas or other things they might be interested in. This can be turned of in their settings.

Activities include posts and tasks.

####Posts

Posts will be the first thing to appear (by default) under the activity feed on the user's home page. A post on Locuscraft is very similar to a post on reddit in that any user can make a post on Locuscraft. Likewise, interests are similar to subreddits (in regard to the fact that adding an interests is like subscribing to a subreddit). Just like on Reddit, a post is simply text or a link to something (we could include media uploads too). Users will be able to comment on posts as well.

The key differences will be in the way posts are rated and organized. 

**Rating**

Reddit's upvoting and downvoting system has been criticized for [being prone to groupthink](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a9335/upvotes-downvotes-and-the-science-of-the-reddit-hivemind-15784871/) and [for being abused by its users](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1wfgur/reddits_voting_system_discourages_dissent_cmv/). To address this, we must have a new system of rating. The website Slashdot has tried to address this issue with [a system of moderators](http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml?source=autorefresh). This is an option and provides some ideas, but I believe the best solutions are the most simple and eloquent. The best system of moderation would give everyone moderation powers rather than a select few, effectively allowing all users to run Locuscraft and the internet itself, as is our goal. 

Here's what we do for comments: we give all users, say ten "tokens" per day. A token can be used to like or dislike a comment. This will encourage users to think more before they like or dislike a comment. I don't know how well this would solve groupthink, but seems like it would work. Community points could be awarded for highly rated comments.

Now for posts: let users rate posts in various aspects on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. User's would have to rate *specific aspects* of the post rather than giving the post itself a single rating. This would help eliminate people liking or disliking for different reasons, and it would help users understand the quality of the post in different aspects, *and* could help to sort/categorize posts based on different criteria. Taking an article as an example, the user could rate it in content, interest, relevance, writing quality, references, etc. There could be a dozen criteria to rate the article in, and not all users will want to do this all the time, so users would be able to rate as many criteria as they choose. To prevent abuse of the system, community points could not be awarded. Each criteria will receive an average rating based on all user ratings in that criteria. The post itself will receive a rating based on the average of it's criteria ratings.

**Organization**

By default, posts from all the user's interests will be displayed and they will be listed based on the number of ratings and value of the rating. There will be ten posts on the homepage, with an option to "see more" which will simply extend the page and show ten more posts. Below this option, will be the next subdivision of activity which is tasks.

The user will have the option to *filter* the posts based on interest, selectively including and omitting the interests they choose. They can also filter by content, selectively including and omitting articles, videos, gifs, text, images, etc. Furthermore, they will be able to filter based on the criteria rated by users. Since this varies based on the content, it will be a subdivision of the content filter.

The user will also be able to *sort* the posts by newness, ratings over different times (day, week, year...), number of views, number of comments, rising (suddenly receiving lots of ratings), and maybe some other criteria.

Users can go to the entry page for one of their interests and filter and sort posts within that interest in the same fashion.

####Tasks

All tasks require the completion of some sort of work on the part of the user. Tasks come in two forms: community tasks and goals.

#####Community Tasks

Community tasks have a few similarities to posts. Like posts community tasks are always associated with a specific entry/interest. They also have their own feed on the activity feed like posts, and will be sortable/filterable. 

They are different from posts in that they contribute to other users of Locuscraft, rather than to the entertainment or knowledge of the individual. You could call this the "build" part of the Locuscraft motto. To compensate users for completing tasks and doing their part, community points are awarded to the user.

Community tasks will vary based on the entry they are associated with, but examples include:

* Complete surveys
* Categorize websites by linking them to entries
* Add descriptions to entries
* Answer user questions
* Be active in forums
* Help create buying guides, how-to guides, or learning guides (or linking guides)
* Participate in opinion polls
* Review answers
 
We want people to express their opinion as much as possible too. That includes hearing what people like and dislike. We could have people make lists of their favorite things, or of their least favorite things, and combine them to see what the average global consensus is on something.

You might ask, how can we know if a user is being honest on community tasks and not just farming for points or trolling? There are a few measures we can take to validate answers:

* Spellcheck to make sure real words were used
* Having other users in the community check their answers. This, itself, could be another community task, to check users and validate that they gave an actual response, or linked an actual website, or wrote an actual description.
* There could just be a system of ratings whereby good contributions are visible and poor contributions are buried.

Community tasks will be sorted by importance or urgency by default. *There will likely be other ways to sort them, but I haven't figured this out yet.*

#####My Tasks

My Tasks are unlike posts and community goals in that they aren't subscribed to, but are instead created by the user for individual reasons. Being personal, they don't award community points. These tasks can be short-term or long-term. They include the user's daily to-do's as well as their long-term goals in life. 

The user's personal tasks can be displayed on their homepage in timeline format or in list format. Typically it will be displayed in order of which one needs to be completed soonest, but it can be sorted or filtered like posts/community tasks.

Each task has a variety of entry fields, tools, and settings that can be customized to fit the task. Our goal in designing My Tasks is to give the user as many tools as possible to assist them in completing that goal, so this list will surely be lengthened.

Entry fields include:

* Title
* Any number of text fields (description, commentary, notes, logs) which may be listed and have nested lists.
* Resources (links, interests, uploads, related tasks/posts)

Settings and tools include:

* Priority
* Urgency
* Start time
* Deadline/expiration/end time
* Recurrence or multiple specific timeframes
* Reminders
* Specific tools such as calculators, generators, free design software

Tasks and sub-tasks can be marked by the user as not started, in progress, incomplete, or complete.

Tasks can also be organized into separate lists, and the list given a name, to group tasks together. For example one may want to make a list of goals, or a to-do list.

An example of a personal task could be to learn more about carpentry. It's title would be "Learn more about carpentry". The user could find the carpentry entry on locuscraft and link it to the task as a resource. They could have the Carpentry activity feed be displayed under the task. They could link specific videos or websites as well. They can write a description detailing specifically what they know and want to learn. They can set a timeframe to work on this the following day from 10 AM to 11:30 AM and recurring every day after for a week. They could create sub-tasks for each day that must be completed in order, such as watch these videos, then build this, then build that. The user could share their task by posting it on Carpentry. It may not get any hits, but who knows? The user could go a step further by helping create a step-by-step learning guide under Carpentry, and earn community points in the process.

Locuscraft will also give suggestions to the user to give them ideas. Here's some examples we might suggest:

* Create a daily journal.
* Add birthdays to your calendar.
* Make a list of personal goals.
* List your ideal daily routine. (Give examples too)
* Try cooking some highly rated recipes! (Recipes can be added as tasks)
* Create a daily exercise routine.
* Create a daily meditation task.
* Work on a diet regimen! (Link to a guide)

###Customization

The user will be able to organize the layout of their homepage. This means they will be able to move My Tasks, Posts, tools, and other things around on the page.

In addition they will be able to customize the format to some extent. I'm thinking the colors, background images, and perhaps the font. There could also be avatar pictures, maybe? These could be integrated as rewards for certain amounts of community points.

This part is not well established yet because it is low on the list of priorities.

##Privacy

Privacy is extremely important for a website like this. Users need to feel secure in knowing the vast amount of information Locuscraft stores about them is not going to be shared with anyone, unless they themselves share it.

At the same time however, there is a lot of information that could be beneficial to the world. Statistical type information mainly. This information can be collected anonymously however. 

We will have to write a privacy policy, and my legalese is pretty bad. Any takers?

##Other Notes

To make use of the plethora of information already available on the internet, I think it will be important to partner with other websites and organizations to make their resources available to Locuscraft users. For example Khan Academy could be one such website that could help users complete tasks relating to subjects on their website.
